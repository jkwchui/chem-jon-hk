# Teaching

I wrote this series on teaching because writing helps thinking clearly.  This is a learning tool for me.

The series is organized, from big to small, as follows:

1. [**Priorities**](./priorities.html).  When ambiguity arises, these inform how one ought to decide.

2. [**Habits**](./habits.html).  The _modus operanti_, the standard ways of operating, what generally works.  The standard plays.

    2.5. [**Techniques**](techniques.html).  The technical aspects to support implementing the doctrines.  HOW-TO on LaTeX, Illustrator, day-to-day tech chains.

3. [**Plays**](./plays.html).  Specific activities that suits the landscape and purpose.

One of my guiding principles is that *context matters*, so it is only fair that we state my context upfront.  Not everything can - or should - be universal.

## Context

I teach exclusively IB Diploma chemistry, to students 16-20 yr old.  Class sizes are small (avg 15 students), and I teach 5 classes (~70 students) each year. The technical support team is superb. I teach in one lab exclusively and can decorate the room.  There is only one fumehood and the furniture is immobile.  A projector and whiteboard is available.

Students come from a range of academic, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds.

* chemistry
* math
* language
* educational
    * prior success strategies
    * relationship with teachers
* technological
* developmental

Teaching time is severely limited; depending on calendar, in the past years I had between 153 to 178 hours to teach a 240 hr course (65% - 75%).  Meeting students 1-on-1 formally is often difficult as I'm often booked from 8:20 - 6 pm.
