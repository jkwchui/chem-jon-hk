The things we do everyday, the standard way of operating.

Situational awareness.

Standardization of components enables creations of greater complexity.

## Drawing-based teaching / note template

What is convenient for teacher is not necessarily easy for students.

Outside:
* oxidation numbers before balancing redox equations before applications

Maturation time / asynchronicity

### Kahoot-quiz-test

Purpose of quizzes and tests as preparations

## Writing Tests / Quizzes

### Preparing tests

Value of writing my own tests
* my education
* fitting needs
* makes marking easier

Centrepiece + filling in gaps

Draft key -> marking -> common errors

### Grading tests

Marking with multi-colored pens
Red: correction
Green: correct
Brown/purple: comments

## Feedback / survey

Two tokens on the table
