# Marking IAs

*This essay describes how I mark Chemistry IAs.*

As an IB DP chemistry specialist, I supervise a large number of IAs.  Each year I try to improve on the accuracy and workflow of marking IAs.  This is my workflow of 2019.

## 1. Authenticate the work

Since I am in touch with students throughout the development of their IA, academic honesty with respect to the *experimental work* is usually a given.  I do two checks:

* **TurnItIn Threshold**.  Our school uses the ManageBac platform, which is integrated with TurnItIn for plagiarism detection.  My curiosity gets automatically triggered when the threshold exceeds 15%.  This generates quite a few false positives but I think academic honesty is important enough.

* **Manual**.  As of about 2016, TurnItIn didn't catch "ghosting".  It could not catch permutation of "dog ate my homework" into "my homework was eaten by a dog".  For this, I look for mismatch language and *non-sequitur* leaps of reasoning; when I am not sure about the full authorship I go quite deep in the rabbit hole.[^prep]

[^prep]: It helps to read as much as you can about IAs, and get a sense of what students *who you don't teach* are doing.

## 2. Setup rubric / form

The IBO mandates the five criteria, each of which are formed from several aspects.  Without an explicit rubric, I tend to either weigh the aspects inconsistently, or missed some aspects completely.

<IA-Criteria />

The syllabus does not specify the weighing of the aspects, and I find that some ought to be more important than others.  So *I* do the splitting, in 0.25 increments, as follows:

<IA-CriteriaTreemap />

For ICT IAs, *safety / ethics* (0.75) is not evaluated and those marks are re-assigned into Methodology (0.50) and Background (0.25).

I developed a form for entering these scores and associated comments.  I change it after each year's grading session; I won't remember what needs to be modified the year after.  When I mark, I keep the form open on one half of my screen and comment on the other half.

As I subscribe to [AirTable](https://www.airtable.com), I use an Airtable form.  I bridge this to the Page-Designer block.  A Google Sheet linked Form would work just fine.

Note that the form goes Comm -> Ex -> An -> CE -> PE.

## 3. Marking

Let's start with the nitty-gritty involved in marking.  As far as I know what the moderators can see in RMAssessor is **limited to what is visible with no interactions**.  In other words,

* visible: handwriting -> scan
* visible: review points on Word -> PDF
* visible: textbox on PDF
* NOT: sticky notes of any kind. This includes from
  * Adobe Acrobat,
  * ManageBac,
  * Skim on macOS...

If they are "sticky note" already, and you have a subscription to Acrobat, you can "print" PDF with comments on. The comments are "printed" to a separate page and would thus be visible.

::: tip How do *you* know sticky notes are invisible?

Painfully.  In 2018 my score was moderated and I could finally ask for moderator comments.  It came back saying "teacher should give reasoning for how criteria scores are assigned".

I am still a little angry.  Because I *didn't* know whether my comments are visible, I attach a preamble where I explicit put in screenshots of what *should* be seen, and ask that if these *cannot* be seen, the examiner to escalate the issue and request for info from the school.
