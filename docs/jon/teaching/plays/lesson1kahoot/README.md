Beginning of the year
First class
Show how class works
Diverse students
Fun
Set tone
Other classes would have had "the chat" too - the fourth hour of the chat

Each student receives a personalized Google folder before class

Q1 - After class, you forgot what you learnt.  This makes you:

* Human (Y)
* A failure
* Stupid
* A bad student

Everyone forgets - but you need to take action to prevent that from happening.

Q2 - In class it is OK to:

* Stand up (Y)
* Move around (Y)
* Email / FB / insta / whatsapp / Snapchat / QQ / Line / weChat / ...
* poke your classmate 

Principle: not disrupting others.  Second hand smoke effect of electronics.  (Also, more than one right answer!)

Q3 - This gesture means:

* OK (Y)
* Draw a circle
* OK? (Y)
* You are getting a 3

Not everyone have seen the same gesture!

It's OK to get a 3; you are not other people and their expectation is not your expectation.

Q4 - this gesture means:

* Something's wrong (Y)
* Let's go swimming
* It's cold

Q5 - this gesture means:

* Take another step / expand on it (Y)
* You're crazy
* Start from the beginning
* Think

Q6 - Your fav class is:

* Chemistry (Y)
* Visual Arts (Y)
* French Ab Initio (Y)
* Maths studies (Y)

"Just because I'm a chemist doesn't mean *you* need to be a chemist.  Chemistry is useful for whatever you end up doing, but it doesn't need to be your fav."  And then - you don't need to like it to be good at it.  When you get good at it you like it.

Maths requirements.

I'm in French ab class / about learning.

Q7 - If you sleep in class, Jon will:

* Check if you are OK (Y)
* Shout at you
* Ask you to leave the class
* Mark you absent

B12 deficiency, lifestyle choices
Not a shouter, wanting you to grow to be good people and shouting at you isn't it

Q8 - Jon gets angry when students:

* Cheat (Y)
* Lie (Y)
* Come late to class
* Skip class

No buttons to push.

Not true - lies & cheating & being unfair to other people.

Marking absent - self-marking entry, taking notes.

Dense classes - 240 in 160, missing classes are v hard to catch up.  Google drive / notes demo, necessity to catch up.

Q9 - If you go to bathroom without asking, Jon will:

* ...understand (Y)
* ...get really angry

Q10 - If you go to the bathroom 3rd time in a class, Jon will:

* ...**not** understand (Y)
* ...get really angry

...unless you go to bathroom 3 times in a row, in which case I will **not** understand.  (But why should I get angry over it?)

Q11 - Your first test is in...

* 15 days (Y)
* a month
* before China Week
* Christmas

Assessment calendar
Habit forming
Purpose of tests as ensuring satisfaction of prerequisites

Q12 - Jon recommends practicing out-of-class for ?? hours/week

* 2
* 3.5 (Y)
* 5
* 8

How many days
How many minutes for 3.5 h/wk?
Is it easy?
Short bit daily harder than you think

Q13 - If you study for 8 hours every week, you can get a:

* 7 (Y)
* 5 (Y)
* 4 (Y)
* 3 (Y)

It's not the quantity, but also the quality - focus, efficiency; how you practice matters.

Q14 - Everyone should get a 7.

* Y
* N (Y)

Other ppl's goal is not your goal.  Each student comes with different bkg.  "Top student in country" means top-3 in world, or 3 years behind others on average.

Possible if you dedicate yourself, but chemistry is not necessary what you want to dedicate yourself to.

All I ask is that you work to better than you were, take the opportunity.

Q15 - What's in your Google folder:

* Textbook + answers (Y)
* Notes, activities, and presentations (Y)
* 500 hr of past papers (Y)
* 5 years of past test (Y)

Show.

Describe me; not to impress them but for them to have confidence that I know what I am doing.
