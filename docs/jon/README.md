# About Jon

Fortune struck for me to spend a dozen years in Italy ([UWCAd](http://www.uwcad.it)) and Canada ([SFU](http://www.sfu.ca), [UVic](http://www.uvic.ca), [Merck-Frosst](https://www.merck.com/)). I got to know many good people, and be mentored by Anne Brearley, Mark Sylvester, and Tom M. Fyles.

Fortune struck twice for me to be back in Hong Kong, 10 min from where I grew up, with the UWC movement. Fortune struck once more when Eli chose me.

At the [United World College of Hong Kong](www.lpcuwc.edu.hk), I teach chemistry and tell tragicomic stories, mostly about myself. I also work with the IBO.
