# About me

I imagine nonexistent things then make them exist.  I enjoy making useful things and making things useful.  I love to learn and to practice. I adore simplicity and symmetry.

I work at the [United World College of Hong Kong](www.lpcuwc.edu.hk). There, I teach chemistry and tell tragicomic stories, mostly about myself. I also work with the IBO.
