# Registry of Interests

On this page I list all sources of income and hospitality or gifts I receive except from family and friends.

I endorse different persons, institutions, and services in these publicly accessible writings. It is important for you to know if I am paid to say write what I write, and if I am, who is paying me. I believe all documents should come with such accountability and transparency, especially with the media and our politicians. The development and maintenance of this registry was inspired by [George Monbiot](http://www.monbiot.com/registry-of-interests/)â€˜s example.

I teach at the [Li Po Chun United World College](http://www.lpcuwc.edu.hk/) in Hong Kong. I also work for the [IBO](http://www.ibo.org/).

I co-lead the Coral Monitoring programme, which was partly sponsored by [WWF-HK](https://www.wwf.org.hk/) from 2012--2014. We have a long term service exchange with [Splash diving company](https://www.splashhk.com/).
