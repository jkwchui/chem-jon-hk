      p Aim to do each within 20 seconds.  You can use calculators to handle the arithmetic.

      p If you get some wrong, it is probably because you skipped steps.

          | Do this on paper.
        el-collapse-item(title="Essential Habit 2" name="2")
          | Break each conversion into steps.  Use a conversion factor to change hour to minutes, #[i then] convert minutes to seconds.  You trade speed for accuracy, and it is a good trade.  #[strong There is no prize for the first to be wrong.]
        el-collapse-item(title="Essential Habit 3" name="3")
          | Write out all units explicitly.  Cross out units.  What remains should be "sec".  If it is not, something is wrong with your set up.

    template(v-slot:reflect='')
      p Sometimes we even do the calculations #[i without] the numbers, just with units, to make sure that the calculations would work out.  This is called a #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis") Dimensional Analysis].
      p Good habits usually look trivial at the beginning.  However, they make hard things easy, and impossible things possible.
      p 25% of you will forget about the value of good habit before it becomes a habit.  When you work in a group, and you notice your friends skipping steps, point it out to them gently but firmly.  Be one another's angels ðŸ˜‡.
