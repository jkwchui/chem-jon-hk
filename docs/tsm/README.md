I having been teaching DP Chemistry exclusively since 2012.  The specialization means that I have not only thought deeply about the structure and delivery of the program (esp. w.r.t. the IA), but also that I have a broad trove of IA examples to draw from.

* In 2016, with permission from my students, I shared a set of 20 annotated IA exemplars (scoring >20 / 24), including both practical and ICT IAs, for the 2016-22 syllabus with the community in the Teacher Resource Exchange (which I initiated and maintain after migration from OCC).  I have added to that collection since.
* I wrote an article, [Managing IAs](https://www.jon.hk/jon/teaching/plays/managing-IA/), summarizing the timeline, logistics, and technical setup for supervising a large number of IAs.
* An example of an IA-related activity: I ask students to critique a sample IA, which forms part of a larger activity of searching and organizing the technical literature.  The critique activity can be found [here](https://www.jon.hk/chem/IA/critique-ex.html)
* I am developing a [step-by-step guide](https://www.jon.hk/chem/IA/) for students to consult in various stages of their IA.

An interest in learning theory, together with the diversity of our students, from chemistry background to language / study skills, also informs the peculiar sequencing and pedagogy I do.  

* Instead of a linear march through, I interweave topics, and uses formative and summative assessments as, well, assessments and not judgment: they are there to see if students are ready for the next stage.  (E.g., I believe it is pointless to try teaching combination of uncertainty if most students cannot convert between absolute and relative uncertainties.)  The choreographed chaos may be controversial, but would be a perspective that may provide a launching point for future developments.
* I developed supporting structure / material for students that places emphasis on student self-management, as well as providing regressions & progressions.  An example problem set, with key, on Topic 11A (uncertainty) is attached.

I am trained as a physical organic chemist, but over the past few years I have worked in significant amounts of ICT into my teaching.
* I co-developed, and facilitated, the Cat. 3 workshops (f2f, online) for ICT in Chemistry
* I developed a set of kinetics and equilibrium simulations, where students can interactively explore the statistical basis for chemical kinetics and its progression to equilibrium.  Description, simulations, and accompanying worksheets can be found [here](https://www.jon.hk/jon/teaching/plays/kineqmsim/)
* I setup a server enabling browser-based molecular modelling, and supports student’s usage in their IAs.  Attached is a a graphical handout describing some of the possibilities in investigating conformation, and a student IA doing such a molecular modelling investigation.  A sample tutorial showing a first exposure to molecular modelling of the Morse curve can be found at https://www.jon.hk/chem/skills/mol-model/HHenergy.html
* Students routinely perform docking experiments to investigate protein—drug interactions, using a combination of AutoDock and SwissDock
* I developed series of spreadsheet video tutorials / scaffolded templates that lead up to intermediate spreadsheet skills such as INDEX(MATCH(), MATCH()) usage.  These can be found at https://www.jon.hk/chem/skills/analysis/spreadsheet/
* I integrate database activities, from introductory to advanced skills as such programmatic access of PubChem through its PUG-REST API, as core and bespoke IA/EE-related tutorials.

Perhaps unexpectedly, after all the bullet-points, I believe my most unique contribution to the team would be my ability to visualize other people’s ideas in real time.  I do not mean sketching an experimental setup, nor merely graphical facilitation; but drawing from a large visual vocabulary to organize, connect, and illustrate ideas.  Meetings are more productive when people can see, and have an unique representation to refer to, even after the transient words faded.

In lieu of meeting notes — which are sometimes regarded as art-pieces collected by students — I have attached a copy of my notes on the first part of Topic 11A, pointing to the usage of space, color, and structures to organize the progression of techniques.  The full set of notes (dated, but more-or-less complete) can be seen at https://www.jon.hk/chem/resources/notes/

Lastly, as a dabbling programmer broadly versed in Python and Javascript ecology, I could also advise on the technical feasibility of intended projects.
