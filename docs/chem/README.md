# IB Chemistry

These pages support the learning and teaching of International Baccalaureate chemistry.  The primary audience are my students and I specify the timeline and logistics for them.  If you are a student  visiting from elsewhere, you would nonetheless find the IA section and interactive resources interesting.

The secondary audience are teachers.  The IB diploma is seeing rapid adoption, and many colleagues are new to the curriculum.  Additional notes on pedagogy, thinking behind explanation, and caveats are hidden on the page and can be viewed by toggling on the Teacher slider.  For more resources I suggest you to subscribe to our Teacher Resource Exchange.  Instructions for access can be found on the myIB forums.
