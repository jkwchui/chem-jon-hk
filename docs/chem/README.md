# IB Chemistry

These pages support the learning and teaching of chemistry at a Year 11-13 / first-year university level.  Specifically this caters to the International Baccalaureate diploma which I have taught ad examined for a number of years.

There are already excellent books and websites, authored by chem teachers that I admire.  However, the medium of books and webpages restrict their authors to 

1. words, which is by nature sequentially and holds one idea at a time, and
2. pictures that describes *states*, conditions before and after the interesting things happening

This is my attempt to complement their work with:

* **visual** overviews, and
* **animations** that try to capture *transitions*, the exact moments where the interesting things are happen*ing*

The primary audience are my students and I specify the timeline and logistics for them.

The secondary audience are teachers.  The IB diploma is seeing rapid adoption, and many colleagues are new to the curriculum.  Additional notes on pedagogy, thinking behind explanation, and caveats are hidden on the page and can be viewed by toggling on the Teacher slider.
