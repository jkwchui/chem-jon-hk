What does this mean? This video of Audrey and Stephanie will give you a sense of the magnitude and attitude that the above phrase means.

In reality, satisfying this requirement requires you to develop habits in:

- Staying organized
- Quasi-daily maintenance,
- Focussed, effective practice

**You should expect to devote 3.5 hours / week**. The hours required increases if you have ineffective habits.

## Practice

There are type of activities that may be practice, and some that are definitely not practice.

Activities that could contribute to practice, in increasing intensity:

- solving “worked examples” (with as little help from the working as possible)
- solving in-between sub-chapter questions in textbook
- solving end-of-chapter questions in textbook
- solving past papers (by topic)
- solving past paper (full year)
- solving past test / quizzes
- making a hypothesis and testing it in AtomSmith / Yenka / WebMO / other simulations
- building your own simulations to model a phenomena

Activities that are definitely not practice:

- (re-) reading textbook / study guide
- (re-) reading notes
- reading articles on the internet
- watching instructional videos
- highlighting
- decorating notes
- memorizing (textbook, study guide, notes…)
- using Anki decks
