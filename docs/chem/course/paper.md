#### Y1 Exam

##### Info

* **When?** 3 May (Fri) afternoon session
* **How?** 
  * 1 hour of Paper 1.  This consists of 40 multiple choice questions.  Answer on the bubble sheet.  No calculators or Data Booklets are permitted, but a Periodic Table is supplied at the end of the questions.  You can tear off this periodic table for reference.
  * 1 hour of Paper 2.  This consists of 40 points of short answers.  Data Booklets are provided, and calculators are permitted.
* **What?** See "topics" section below for a listing of what content is included.  Use the *Filter* and *Sort* functions to identify what is in HL/core syllabus.  **Questions from previous tests reappears in both papers.  Please do not make the same mistakes again.**
* **How do I do well?**
  * If you have been doing 3.5 hr / wk of practice every week, and Anki decks for maintenance, then in this week just do some of the past Y1 exams (printed for you).  Review your past mistakes in previous tests.
  * If you have had some weeks on, some weeks off, and irregular Anki decks, then in this order (as time allows):
    1. Practice with end-of-textbook questions,
    2. Review your previous tests,
    3. Practice with past papers by topics,
    4. Practice with past tests (printed)

### Y2

The trial exam uses a complete set of IB papers I (60 min) and II (2 h 15 min) from 2018.  Please refrain from these in your practices. -->

## Grade calculations

<Foldable>

Term grades calculations are tabulated as follows:

<center>

|        | Test | Quizzes | Labs |
|:------:|:----:|:-------:|:----:|
| Term 1 | 80%  |   20%   |  -   |
| Term 2 | 60%  |   20%   | 20%  |
| Term 3 | 80%  |   20%   |  -   |

</center>

Composed grades are formed from term grades and exams:

<center>

|        | Term 1 | Term 2 | Y1 exam | Term 3 | Trials | IA  |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:---:|
| Year 1 |  20%   |  60%   |   20%   |   -    |   -    |  -  |
|PG (Nov)|  15%   |   25%  |   30%   |   30%  |   -    |  -  |
|PG (Nov)^*^|  0% |   30%  |   30%   |   40%  |   -    |  -  |
| Term 4 |   -    |   -    |    -    |   -    |  80%   | 20% |

</center>

Predicted grades admit the following exceptions:

1. **language / background disadvantage**.  Students who had significant language/academic background deficiency will have their Term 1 grade omitted.[^calc]
2. **IA**.  IAs that are likely to be significantly better / worse than current performance gets a modifier.  This is usually < Â±5%.

[^calc]: In practice I just calculate *both* variants for each student, and take the better one.  Too-clever kids believe they can game the system and waltz throughout Term 1.  Their poor preparations will dig them into a hole.

![Grade graph](/image/gradegraph.png)

Once a term I email each of you a graph with all assessments plotted as a time-series.  This is to help you help me make sure my numbers are legit, and for you to get a sense of your progression.

</Foldable>

### Grade boundaries

Our internal grade boundaries are based on the IB chemistry grade boundaries.  The distribution is as follows:

<center>

|   %   | Grade |
|:-----:|:-----:|
| 80+   |   7   |
| 70-79 |   6   |
| 60-69 |   5   |
| 49-59 |   4   |
| 35-48 |   3   |
| 19-34 |   2   |

</center>

### Effort Grades

<Foldable>

Each term you are also given an Effort Grade.  For me, Effort Grade defaults to a `D`.  This is then modified up by 
**evidence of practice / maintenance**.  As a general rule of thumb,

| EG  |      Practice (hr/wk)       | Maintenance (min) |
|:---:|:---------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| `A` |             3.5             |             10; 5 d/wk             |
| `B` |              2              |             10; 2 d/wk             |
| `C` |              1              |             10; 1 d/wk             |
| `D` | cram before quizzes / tests |              n/a               |

I periodically sample the Big Chart for evidence.  If you practice in other ways you need to show me evidence for them.  I do not take *intentions* as substitute for *actions*.

The science department has a set of descriptors posted on the wall.  These include attendance and attitude. For me some are expectataions, and others are quite subjective.  These factor in the consideration in a minor way.
