<Subsubtopic id='11.3.G3' type='Guidance' content='The data booklet contains characteristic ranges for IR absorptions (section 26), 1H NMR data (section 27) and specific MS fragments (section 28). For 1H NMR, only the ability to deduce the number of different hydrogen (proton) environments and the relative numbers of hydrogen atoms in each environment is required. Integration traces should be covered but splitting patterns are not required.' />

<Subsubtopic id='21.1.G1' type='Guidance' content='Students should be able to interpret the following from 1H NMR spectra: number of peaks, area under each peak, chemical shift and splitting patterns. Treatment of spin-spin coupling constants will not be assessed but students should be familiar with singlets, doublets, triplets and quartets.' />

<Subsubtopic id='21.1.IM1' type='International-mindedness' content='The chemical community often shares chemical structural information on the international stage. The Cambridge Crystallographic Database, ChemSpider developed by the Royal Society of Chemistry and the Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) (at Brookhaven National Laboratory, USA) are examples which highlight the international nature of the scientific community.' />
<Subsubtopic id='21.1.ToK1' type='Theory of Knowledge' content='The intensity ratio of the lines in the high resolution NMR spectrum is given by the numbers in Pascals triangle, a mathematical pattern known independently over a thousand years ago by a number of different cultures.
