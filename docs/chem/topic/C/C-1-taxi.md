# The Taxi Problem

<Subsubtopic id='C.1.Aims2' type='Aims' content='Aim 6: The energy density of different fuels could be investigated experimentally.' />

The year is 2000.  You have been appointed the ðŸšš Transport Secretary of Hong Kong ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°.  It is known to be "more environmentally friendly" for cars to run on LPG instead of gasoline, and you want the taxis ðŸš• to all change to using LPG.  Fuel costs are actually lower using LPG too, so it's win-win all around.

However, using LPG requires switching out the engine (which is  expensive) and the taxi owners are asking for a subsidy.  The Chief Executive asked you to make a decision about how much ðŸ’° is the right subsidy.
