## Sources and Flow

<Subsubtopic id='C.1.U1' type='Understandings' content='A useful energy source releases energy at a reasonable rate and produces minimal pollution.' />

## Energy Efficiency

<Subsubtopic id='C.1.U2' type='Understandings' content='The quality of energy is degraded as heat is transferred to the surroundings. Energy and materials go from a concentrated into a dispersed form. The quantity of the energy available for doing work decreases.' />
<Subsubtopic id='C.1.AS4' type='Applications and skills' content='Determination of the efficiency of an energy transfer process from appropriate data.' />

## Sustainability 
<Subsubtopic id='C.1.U3' type='Understandings' content='Renewable energy sources are naturally replenished. Non-renewable energy sources are finite.' />
<Subsubtopic id='C.1.AS1' type='Applications and skills' content='Discussion of the use of different sources of renewable and non-renewable energy.' />

## Energy Densities
<Subsubtopic id='C.1.U4' type='Understandings' content='Energy density = energy released from fuel / volume of fuel consumed.' />
