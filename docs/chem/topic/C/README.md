# Option C: Energy

<Subsubtopic id='C.1.NoS' type='Nature of Science' content='Use theories to explain natural phenomenaâ€”energy changes in the world around us result from potential and kinetic energy changes at the molecular level. Energy has both quantity and quality. ' />

::: tip Why we study Energy as the option

* *Energy* synergies better with *Chemistry* than all other options.  This is the most important reason.  The link between *Energy* and the rest of the syllabus is tighter, and studying it reinforces what you have learnt better than the other options.
* Related to above, *Energy* is easier / higher scoring for most students.  (Exception: students with strong Bio & weak Chem.)
* *Energy* synergizes with Physics and ESS, the same way *Biochem* (Opt B) synergizes with Bio.  (*A - Materials* and *D - Medicine* just end up having lots of shallow memorization.)  Opt C is renewable energy / solar / global warming, so definitely much more ESS than Biochem.

I have limited capacity to provide support if you choose to study Opt B, but you can certainly choose to study it instead.  My belief --- having taught all four options and as a senior examiner for HL P3 --- is that *Energy* is a better choice for all students including bio students; you have indeed already learnt something about protein and DNA, but you have also learnt your combustion, isotopes, and acidification.
