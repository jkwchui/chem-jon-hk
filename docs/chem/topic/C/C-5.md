### Kinds of greenhouse gases

<Subsubtopic id='C.5.AS3' type='Applications and skills' content='Discussion of the sources, relative abundance and effects of different greenhouse gases.' />
<Subsubtopic id='C.5.G1' type='Guidance' content='Greenhouse gases to be considered are CH4, H2O and CO2.' />

### How greenhouse gases warm the climate

<Subsubtopic id='C.5.AS1' type='Applications and skills' content='Explanation of the molecular mechanisms by which greenhouse gases absorb infrared radiation.' />
<Subsubtopic id='C.5.U3' type='Understandings' content='Greenhouse gases absorb IR radiation as there is a change in dipole moment as the bonds in the molecule stretch and bend.' />

### Other environmental impact of greenhouse gases

### Carbon Footprint

<Subsubtopic id='C.2.U7' type='Understandings' content='A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases produced during human activities. It is generally expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide.' />

<Subsubtopic id='C.2.AS6' type='Applications and skills' content='Calculations of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere, when different fuels burn and determination of carbon footprints for different activities.' />

<Subsubtopic id='C.2.Aims3' type='Aims' content='Aim 7: Many online calculators are available to calculate carbon footprints.' />

### Sustainability measures

<Subsubtopic id='C.5.IM1' type='International-mindedness' content='This issue involves the international community working together to research and reduce the effects of global warming. Such attempts include the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Kyoto Protocol which was extended in Qatar.' />
<Subsubtopic id='C.5.ToK1' type='Theory of Knowledge' content='Some people question the reality of climate change, and question the motives of scientists who have “exaggerated” the problem. How do we assess the evidence collected and the models used to predict the impact of human activities?' />
<Subsubtopic id='C.5.Aims3' type='Aims' content='Aim 8: Discussions of climate change and green chemistry raise awareness of the ethical, economic and environmental implications of using science and technology.' />
