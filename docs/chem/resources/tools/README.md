This page presents some fun toys for getting chemical equations rendered properly, 3D structures, and so on.

## Typeset chemical equations

Type your chemical equation in the box to have it rendered.  Use `\solid{}`, `\aq{}`, `\gas{}`, and `\liquid{}` for state symbols, and `^` / `_` to force super/subscripts.

::: tip

Try pasting `Mg + HNO3 -> H2\gas{} + Mg(NO3)2\aq{}`.


See [mhchem manual](https://mhchem.github.io/MathJax-mhchem/) for additional syntax.
