# Tutorial: Investigating the H-H bond

In this tutorial, I will show you how to do an *ab initio* quantum mechanical calculation using GAMESS.  After finishing this tutorial you will be able to determine:

* Energy of molecules at arbitrary conformations, and
* Optimal geometry of molecules

We will begin with navigating the interface, creating molecules, making measurements, and modifying bond lengths.
