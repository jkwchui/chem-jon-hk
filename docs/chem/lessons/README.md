# eLearning

## How the class works

We have five types of interactions that together makes up "eLearning":

* **Asynchronous interactions**: Because of time-zone differences, we will not be online at the same time.  Microsoft Teams is a chat-room / collaboration tool that let us maintain a single channel of conversation.  When you get onto [*teams.microsoft.com*](https://teams.microsoft.com/) it should automatically put you in the right channel; if not, here is the
link to join the [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a3e4db2c5b7b6483495c0c2d20516ad26%40thread.skype/General?groupId=08733f60-e7db-4fc5-8f35-b0caf52e1834&tenantId=7637b993-7e86-4653-a3e2-c87c46e1321a)

* **Synchronous interactions** ("face-to-face"): We will be doing face-to-face meetings in MS Teams as well.  These meetings can be directly accessed through the Teams channel.

* **Chemistry activities**: we have arranged for two kinds of digital chemistry experiences:
  * *Yenka* is a virtual lab, where you can "react" chemicals and observed properties, whereas
  * *Atomsmith* is a simulation suite for visualizing chemistry at the atomic level.

* **Video lecture**: I'll prepare video lectures that introduces the material.  There are questions / pausing points in there --- I strongly suggest you to give them a try instead of running through it.

* **Practice**: Doing chemistry is a skill.  Just like you can't learn guitar by listening to Spotify or going to a concert, you can't learn chemistry by watching.  Do the advised exercises and upload them to the ManageBac dropboxes.
