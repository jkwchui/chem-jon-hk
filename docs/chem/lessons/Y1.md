## How the class works

<Foldable>

We have five types of interactions that together makes up "eLearning":

* **Asynchronous interactions**: Because of time-zone differences, we will not be online at the same time.  Microsoft Teams is a chat-room / collaboration tool that let us maintain a single channel of conversation.  When you get onto [*teams.microsoft.com*](https://teams.microsoft.com/) it should automatically put you in the right channel; if not, here is the
link to join the [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a3e4db2c5b7b6483495c0c2d20516ad26%40thread.skype/General?groupId=08733f60-e7db-4fc5-8f35-b0caf52e1834&tenantId=7637b993-7e86-4653-a3e2-c87c46e1321a)

* **Synchronous interactions** ("face-to-face"): We will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) as the video conferencing software.  The College had purchased a subscription.  The meetings can be directly accessed through the Teams channel.

* **Chemistry activities**: we have arranged for two kinds of digital chemistry experiences:
  * *Yenka* is a virtual lab, where you can "react" chemicals and observed properties, whereas
  * *Atomsmith* is a simulation suite for visualizing chemistry at the atomic level.

* **Video lecture**: I'll prepare video lectures that introduces the material.  There are questions / pausing points in there --- I strongly suggest you to give them a try instead of running through it.

* **Practice**: Doing chemistry is a skill.  Just like you can't learn guitar by listening to Spotify or going to a concert, you can't learn chemistry by watching.  Do the advised exercises and upload them to the ManageBac dropboxes.

## Lesson 2

Enthalpy lab upload: if you have not yet scanned and uploaded your lab worksheet as a PDF to ManageBac, please do that.

### Enthalpy simulation

For today, install and use Yenka to simulate what you have already done before in the lab.

1. download and install Yenka [here using this link](https://www.yenka.com/en/Download_the_Yenka_installer/). 
2. activate using the code provided in email
3. explore and play with it, then
4. reproduce the enthalpy experiment virtually.  Arrive at a Temp vs time graph for the reaction between 
   * 25 cm^3^ 1.0M HCl and 
   * 25.0 cm^3^ 1.0M NaOH.
5. Save your model and take a screenshot.  Upload to ManageBac dropbox.

### Chemical properties in the periodic table

* Read the textbook chapter 3, pages 111â€“118.
* Complete the exercises in the blue boxes in a chemistry exercise book.
* Check your answers (same folder as textbook)
* Scan the PDF of your **corrected** answer, and upload to MB dropbox by Monday 9 pm HKT.

## Lesson 3

### The taxi problem ðŸš•

::: tip Real time session 

This is a real-time video conferencing session.  The link to join is [here](https://zoom.us/j/361158292?from=msft).

:::

The year is 2000.  You have been appointed the ðŸšš Transport Secretary of Hong Kong ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°.  It is known to be "more environmentally friendly" for cars to run on LPG instead of gasoline, and you want the taxis ðŸš• to all change to using LPG.  Fuel costs are actually lower using LPG too, so it's win-win all around.

However, using LPG requires switching out the engine (which is  expensive) and the taxi owners are asking for a subsidy.  The Chief Executive asked you to make a decision about how much ðŸ’° is the right subsidy.
