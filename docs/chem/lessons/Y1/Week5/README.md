# Week 5

## Preparations

If you are on-campus, you can pick up notes in class or outside the lab.  (If it is raining I may move it inside to protect them from getting wet.)  There are several items to pick up this week:

1. Notes (colorful)
2. Practice quiz (also colorful, with your name)
3. Chemical equations worksheet (black-and-white)

If you are in quarantine, the College Driver will be delivering a set of notes to you.  With fewer students he may not be driving to the hotel every day.

This week's notes [can be downloaded here](/resources/worksheets/Y1-week5-notes.pdf).

Start Session 1 (Pictures) in your first chem lesson, Session 2 (Equations) on the second lesson.  If there are two chem lessons on a day, use only one of them: choose the lesson that is convenient for you.

Come to the lab (A/204) for the physical quiz and lab at the following times:

* **E** (E-15): 10:00-11:00 Tue
* **D** (D-18): 10:00-11:00 Wed
* **B** (B-17): 10:00-11:00 Thu
* **G** (G-17): 10:00-11:00 Fri

If the activities within the session cannot be finished within one hour, complete the remainder at a time of your choosing.

Complete and submit the homework for each session before their due dates.
