# Session Optional: üéº as üåà üì¶ ‚è±

The past two weeks you learnt about ways of seeing data in space with colors.  You can apply this to epidemics, economics, and perhaps surprisingly, even music.

In some way, music is nothing but parallel sequences of sound data in time.

[Beethoven's Fifth Symphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._5_(Beethoven)) is maybe the most recognized and celebrated music on the planet.  The following video by [Stephen Malindowski](https://www.musanim.com) visualizes the performance as colored üåà boxes üì¶ in time   ‚è±.  (I have waited three weeks for this punch line :) )

It's a religious experience when you listen to this with good sound while watching on a large screen.

But music also *isn't* just "parallel sequences of sound data in time."  If you want to learn more about how to listen to the Fifth, the podcast [Switched on Pop](https://switchedonpop.com/) have a series on what is so special about the Fifth, interviewing the New York Philharmonic Orchestra musicians.
