Week 3 is DOPey as we bring back some of you on campus.  Read the instructions carefully.

## Preparations

If you are not in Hong Kong, download and print [this week's notes](/resources/worksheets/Y1-week3-notes.pdf) before continuing.

If you are in Hong Kong, printed notes will be available in your first lesson (see below).  If you want to pick it up earlier, named copies are outside the lab.

If you are in quarantine, the College Driver will deliver a copy for you.

## Overview of this week

The three sessions are Physical, Optional, and Digital.

### Physical session

If you are on-campus, **bring your chem binder** and join us in the lab (A/204).  You join in the lesson which you have your chemistry class (check your timetable!).

* **B**: Thu Sep 24 10:00-11:00
* **D**: Wed Sep 23 10:00-11:00
* **E**: Tue Sep 22 10:00-11:00
* **G**: Fri Sep 25 10:00-11:00

If you are **NOT** on campus, part of this lesson is packaged as the following link.  This will happen *after* our first session on Tuesday.

### Optional session

In these two years I will try to develop you as a whole person.  I do this by connecting what we learnt with culture and ideas that you may not have seen.  These are given as *Optional* sessions and you will see your first one this week.  

In the last two weeks we have been plotting different graphs and drawing different imageries.  In other words, looking broadly at visualizing data with color, time, or boxes.  Our first optional session is visualizing music üéº as colored üåà boxes üì¶ in time ‚è±.

### Digital session

This last session is similar to what you have done in the past weeks.  If you are on-campus, do this in your *other* chemistry lesson.

## Class Collage

In this section I will post a selection of the homework your class submitted.  Check back next week!
