Week 3 is DOPey as we bring back some of you on campus.  Read the instructions carefully.

## Preparations

Download and print [this week's notes](/resources/worksheets/) before continuing.

## Overview of this week

The three sessions are Digital, Optional, and Physical.

### Digital session

This last session is similar to what you have done in the past weeks.  If you are on-campus, do this in your *other* chemistry lesson.

<a href="./SessionD" class="el-button el-button--warning">Session Digital: Volume üí®</a>

### Optional session

In these two years I will try to develop you as a whole person.  I do this by connecting what we learnt with culture and ideas that you may not have seen.  These are given as *Optional* sessions and you will see your first one this week.  

In the last two weeks we have been plotting different graphs and drawing different imageries.  In other words, looking broadly at visualizing data with color, time, or boxes.  Our first optional session is visualizing music üéº as colored üåà boxes üì¶ in time ‚è±.

<a href="./SessionO" class="el-button el-button--warning">Session Optional: üéº as üåà üì¶ ‚è±</a>

### Physical session

If you are on-campus, join us in the lab (A/204) at the following times:

* **B**: Thu Sep 24 10:00-11:00
* **D**: Wed Sep 23 10:00-11:00
* **E**: Tue Sep 22 10:00-11:00
* **G**: Fri Sep 25 10:00-11:00

If you are **NOT** on campus, part of this lesson is packaged as the following link.

## Class Collage

In this section I will post a selection of the homework your class submitted.  Check back next week!
