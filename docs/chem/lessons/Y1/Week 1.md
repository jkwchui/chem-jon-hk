::: warning Difficult situations

I know some of you have restricted access including lack of a computer, power outage, and internet censorship.  I hope the following adjustments mean online learning is still possible.

* **no computer**: I designed and built this website to be mobile-first, and tested everything on a phone myself.  You should be able to access most of what you need.  However, your other experiences (*e.g.*, Google Sheets / Docs) will depend on the extent of that app being available on your phone OS (Operating System).

* **power / Wifi outage**: You are probably also in a different timezone.  This combination means that synchronizing internet access to the class is difficult.  ***That's OK!***  All of the activities in the first weeks are designed so that they can be done in your own time.  We *will* meet but we will tailor meetings to when you are available.

* **internet censorship**: This is difficult.  I don't know what we can do when your state do all it can to keep you from learning :)  
  * If you can get access to a VPN, consider that. 
  * Google is blocked in China, but all the material is on the Google Drive.  I have added a copy to Microsoft Sharepoint that you *may* be able to access though the MS Teams channel.  
  * The videos are hosted on Vimeo, which *usually* can be accessed in China. However, the Great Fire Wall grows higher at sensitive times (for example, 1 Oct).  Do as much as you can when you can access to the outside world.

* **English fluency**: I try to help you get started by providing
  * most material in writing (so you can take your time), 
  * simpler language and slower speech, and
  * videos have captions that you can access by clicking on the CC button on the lower right.  (Well, I try; it's me doing chemistry and art and code and filming and video editing, so these additional pass may not be available immediately.)

I hope this makes enough of the course available to you.  If you have other difficulties that I did not anticipate, let me know, and we see what can be done.

Start Session 1 (*Boxes*) in your first chem lesson, Session 2 (*Time*) on the second lesson, and Session 3 (*Colors*) on the third lesson.  If there are two chem lessons on a day, use only one of them: choose the lesson that is convenient for you.

If the activities within the session cannot be finished within one hour, complete the remainder at a time of your choosing.

Complete and submit the homework for each session before their due dates.

### Homework

No homework today! üôÉ

Before next session, however, you need to watch a video on getting physically organized, and *then* do some shopping at a stationary shop.  

<Vimeo vid='288282144' name="StephanieAudreyStudySkills" />

Here is your shopping list:

1. colored pens
   * **Essential**: (0) a black pen (1) a red pen and (2) a green pen
     * Luxury: Pigment liner pens (e.g., Staedler, micron, pigma).  These are water- and chemical-proof once they dry.  0.3 mm is the right size for the notebook.
     * Super-luxury: an additional black/blue Frixion pen.  The ink in Frixion pens are heat-sensitive, so when there is friction the marks becomes colorless.  In other words, *erasable* ballpoint pens.
   * Nice to have: (3) purple, (4) yellow
   * Luxury: (5) a pack of highlighters of different colors
     * (5b) Super-luxury: [Zebra Mildliner](https://www.zebrapen.com/product/mildliner/) pack of 5 colors
2. a small (passport-sized) notebook.  Small enough that you can carry in your pocket all the time.  This will be your TODO list / thought-catcher.
   * I got mine from Muji ÁÑ°Âç∞ËâØÂìÅ.
3. colored paperclips
4. Sticky notes (Post-Its)
5. 1" (2.5 cm) A4 folder to hold your current chemistry notes.
   * luxury: dividers (I just use paperclips)
   * future-proof: an additional two 3" binders.  If you are organized and diligent, you will work through about 1500 pages of practices.
6. (optional) a deck of playing cards
7. (optional) a pencil case to hold it all together (or rubberbands).

## Session 3: Colors

Make sure you have at least the red and green pens.  Do not continue without them.

### Homework

Hand in on ManageBac as two files: a screenshot and a PDF.  This is due Sunday Sep 13.

#### 1: Rainfall analysis

Your homework this week involves the Hong Kong rainfall data from this spreadsheet (which you have seen before).

You need to use a color scale to visualize it, and add a "danger" color for when the rain was incredibly heavy.

Then you need to identify the month with the most rainy days and heaviest rainfall.  You may need to look up some additional spreadsheet formula.

#### 2: Pomodoro Drawing

Draw me two Pomodoro timers, the first one in 2D (just lines), and the second one in 3D (with stippling or hatching).  Use colors.  Scan these as PDF with Office Lens.

## Class Collage

In this section I will post a selection of the homework your class submitted.  Check back next week!
