# Week 1

## Preparations

Download and print this week's notes before continuing.

::: tip Quarantine

If you are in quarantine, I have prepared a care package for you.  The College driver should be bringing this to you on Monday by noon.  You will find the following inside the care package:
  1. a copy of this week's notes
  2. a red/green pen
  3. post-it notes
  4. snacks

:::

Start Session 1 in your first chem lesson, Session 2 on the second lesson, and Session 3 on the third lesson.  If there are two chem lessons on a day, use only one of them: choose the lesson that is convenient for you.

If the activities within the session cannot be finished within one hour, complete the remainder at a time of your choosing.

Complete and submit the homework for each session before their due dates.
