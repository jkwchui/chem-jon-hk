## Preparations

1. Download and print [this week's notes](/resources/worksheets/Y1-week2-notes.pdf).
2. Watch *Lina Mnemonica* and remember some facts about Lina.
3. Measure the time using your home-made pendulums (see video 🎬 below):
   1. for a 25 cm pendulum to swing back-and-forth 10 times.  Repeat this five times.
   2. for a 50 cm pendulum to swing back-and-forth 10 times.  Repeat this five times.
   3. Enter your measurements on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o7_oGP9fY002_v_mhiKGJfM-EemJBUnvPJDxoIYF1yE/edit?usp=sharing). This must be completed before Tuesday.

😸: Yeaaaah. This is LINA! She was very explosive. Which is why she applies here. It's funny, you see, it's funny. Getting to meet her. Anyways. 

🐟: Hi Jon. 

😸: Lina's not a very good student.  She gets **"C"s** for her Effort Grades.  

🐟: She doesn't even take chemistry now she's learning the Periodic Table.  

😸: Lena speaks Arabic and French. See, when you need to remember just thinking about Lina. You know, if you know her name.

😸: I am Dafna, and I am **NOT** on the Periodic Table.

### Making pendulums

Start Session 1 (*Colors*) in your first chem lesson, Session 2 (*Time*) on the second lesson, and Session 3 (*Boxes*) on the third lesson.  If there are two chem lessons on a day, use only one of them: choose the lesson that is convenient for you.

If the activities within the session cannot be finished within one hour, complete the remainder at a time of your choosing.

Complete and submit the homework for each session before their due dates.
