Start Session 1 () in your first chem lesson, Session 2 () on the second lesson, and Session 3 () on the third lesson.  If there are two chem lessons on a day, use only one of them: choose the lesson that is convenient for you.

If the activities within the session cannot be finished within one hour, complete the remainder at a time of your choosing.

Complete and submit the homework for each session before their due dates.
