# Session 1: Measurements üìè

In this session, students who can be in class will learn and practice:

1. using **significant figures** as implicit uncertainties, and
2. using pipettes, syringes, micropipettes, and burettes for measurements

If you are off-campus, watch the videos on glassware usage.  We will be using them again in the coming week.

### Homework

Add the Anki deck called [Chem Lab Equipment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kk-0JNa9hXK2IHjQYmGp6TFWAjHV6UVw/view?usp=sharing), and learn the names of these chemical equipment.  An A3 sheet with drawing is available for you to take notes.

You have previously printed and completed part of the Measurement practice questions.  Complete Q1--4 and check your answers.  You will be uploading this at the end of the week.  This should take no more than 20 minutes.
