# Week 4

## Preparations

If you are on-campus, you can pick up notes in class or outside the lab.

If you are in quarantine, the College Driver will be delivering a set of notes to you.  With fewer students he may not be driving to the hotel every day.

If you are not in Hong Kong, download and print [this week's notes](/resources/worksheets/Y1-week4-notes.pdf) before continuing.

With public holidays on Thu and Fri, Week 4 is a short week.  Chem will have only two lessons, one of which is a physical lab session.  Depending on your chemistry class, please come to the lab at the following times:
	
* D: Mon 10:00 (D-13)
*	E: Mon 11:05 (E-13)
*	G: Wed 08:30 (G-14)
*	B: Wed 12:30 (B-15)

If you cannot be on-campus, part of the session explaining signficant figures is available here:

<a href="./Session1" class="el-button el-button--success">Session 1: Measurements üìè</a>

The other session is independent of the lab session.  Despite numbered as 2, it can be done either before or after the physical session.

<a href="./Session2" class="el-button el-button--warning">Session 2: Mass ‚öñÔ∏è</a>

## Class Collage

In this section I will post a selection of the homework your class submitted.  Check back next week!
