# Session 1: Structures

## Interacting with Chemical Structures (Intermediate)

In the previous weeks you have interacted with chemical structures, but with notable limits:

1. you *viewed* and *rotated* a selection of structures, without being able to make measurements,
2. the selection have all been examples of "*small molecules*",
3. you have only seen a single copy, when real world molecules exist as a dynamic population

In two sessions this week we will use [AtomSmith](https://www.atomsmith.co) to overcome some of these limits.  Click on the following button, then login using your LPCUWC Google account.  Instructions are in the printed notes; follow to 

1. complete the *Measuring Models of Molecules* and
2. complete the *Exploring Molecules in Your World 2* experiences

You may want to come back to explore and visualize other molecules in the `Molecule Library` as your go through the next section.

You may wonder whether you need to memorize names of chemicals, and if so, which ones you need to memorize.  

In theory, most of the names you need can be found **somewhere** in the Data Booklet, but you will find it to be unacceptably slow if you need to look up *every single noun*.  I advice learning the names for a selection of common chemicals, and this is much easier when you understand the pattern.  The following video guides you through the names, and an accompanying Anki deck reinforces the recall.
