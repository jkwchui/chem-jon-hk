::: warning Difficult situations

I know some of you have restricted access including lack of a computer, power outage, and internet censorship.  I hope the following adjustments mean online learning is still possible.

* **no computer**: I designed and built this website to be mobile-first, and tested everything on a phone myself.  You should be able to access most of what you need.  However, your other experiences (*e.g.*, Google Sheets / Docs) will depend on the extent of that app being available on your phone OS (Operating System).

* **power / Wifi outage**: You are probably also in a different timezone.  This combination means that synchronizing internet access to the class is difficult.  ***That's OK!***  All of the activities in the first weeks are designed so that they can be done in your own time.  We *will* meet but we will tailor meetings to when you are available.

* **internet censorship**: This is difficult.  I don't know what we can do when your state do all it can to keep you from learning :)  
  * If you can get access to a VPN, consider that. 
  * Google is blocked in China, but all the material is on the Google Drive.  I have added a copy to Microsoft Sharepoint that you *may* be able to access though the MS Teams channel.  
  * The videos are hosted on Vimeo, which *usually* can be accessed in China. However, the Great Fire Wall grows higher at sensitive times (for example, 1 Oct).  Do as much as you can when you can access to the outside world.

* **English fluency**: I try to help you get started by providing
  * most material in writing (so you can take your time), 
  * simpler language and slower speech, and
  * videos have captions that you can access by clicking on the CC button on the lower right.  (Well, I try; it's me doing chemistry and art and code and filming and video editing, so additional captioning pass may not be available immediately.)

I hope this makes enough of the course available to you.  If you have other difficulties that I did not anticipate, let me know, and we see what can be done.

Start Session 1 (*Boxes*) in your first chem lesson, Session 2 (*Time*) on the second lesson, and Session 3 (*Colors*) on the third lesson.  If there are two chem lessons on a day, use only one of them: choose the lesson that is convenient for you.

If the activities within the session cannot be finished within one hour, complete the remainder at a time of your choosing.

Complete and submit the homework for each session before their due dates.
