### Homework

No homework today! üôÉ

Before next session, however, you need to watch a video on getting physically organized, and *then* do some shopping at a stationary shop.  

<Vimeo vid='288282144' name="StephanieAudreyStudySkills" />

Here is your shopping list:

1. colored pens
   * **Essential**: (0) a black pen (1) a red pen and (2) a green pen
     * Luxury: Pigment liner pens (e.g., Staedler, micron, pigma).  These are water- and chemical-proof once they dry.  0.3 mm is the right size for the notebook.
     * Super-luxury: an additional black/blue Frixion pen.  The ink in Frixion pens are heat-sensitive, so when there is friction the marks becomes colorless.  In other words, *erasable* ballpoint pens.
   * Nice to have: (3) purple, (4) yellow
   * Luxury: (5) a pack of highlighters of different colors
     * (5b) Super-luxury: [Zebra Mildliner](https://www.zebrapen.com/product/mildliner/) pack of 5 colors
2. a small (passport-sized) notebook.  Small enough that you can carry in your pocket all the time.  This will be your TODO list / thought-catcher.
   * I got mine from Muji ÁÑ°Âç∞ËâØÂìÅ.
3. colored paperclips
4. Sticky notes (Post-Its)
5. 1" (2.5 cm) A4 folder to hold your current chemistry notes.
   * luxury: dividers (I just use paperclips)
   * future-proof: an additional two 3" binders.  If you are organized and diligent, you will work through about 1500 pages of practices.
6. (optional) a deck of playing cards
7. (optional) a pencil case to hold it all together (or rubberbands).
