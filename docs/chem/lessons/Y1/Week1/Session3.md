### Homework

Hand in on ManageBac as two files: a screenshot and a PDF.  This is due Sunday Sep 13.

#### 1: Rainfall analysis

Your homework this week involves working with the Hong Kong rainfall data.

First, use a color scale to visualize it, and add a "danger" color for when the rain was *incredibly* heavy. (It's subjective.)

Second, for each month, calculate:

1. The average rainfall,
2. The number of rainy days, and
3. The number of days with Trace amount of rain


You will probably need to learn some new spreadsheet functions to **COUNT** things and **COUNT**-things-**IF**. (hint, hint)

#### 2: Pomodoro Drawing

Draw me two Pomodoro timers, the first one in 2D (just lines), and the second one in 3D (with stippling or hatching).  Use colors.  Scan these as PDF with Office Lens.
