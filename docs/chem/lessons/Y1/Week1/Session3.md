### Homework

Hand in on ManageBac as two files: a screenshot and a PDF.  This is due Sunday Sep 13.

#### 1: Rainfall analysis

Your homework this week involves the Hong Kong rainfall data from this spreadsheet (which you have seen before).

You need to use a color scale to visualize it, and add a "danger" color for when the rain was incredibly heavy.

Then you need to identify the month with the most rainy days and heaviest rainfall.  You may need to look up some additional spreadsheet formula.

#### 2: Pomodoro Drawing

Draw me two Pomodoro timers, the first one in 2D (just lines), and the second one in 3D (with stippling or hatching).  Use colors.  Scan these as PDF with Office Lens.
