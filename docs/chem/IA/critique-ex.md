# 1B. Critiquing IA Explorations

As a step towards preparing your IA Exploration, you should learn *how* to be critical.  It is considerably easier to be objective to someone else's work than your own, so let's give that a try here.  Spend 15 minutes reading and commenting on Example Elephant's Exploration, then click on the Feedback link to see what I think.  You will need to search and read in order to make intelligent judgment.

## Example Elephant’s IA Exploration

### Research Question

Does acidity change the rate of aspirin hydrolysis?

### Hypothesis

Because acid breaks down molecules, I predict that the higher the pH, the higher the rate of aspirin hydrolysis.  When we plot a graph of rate vs pH, it will be linear with a positive slope.  The line intersects the origin because at 0 pH there is no acid and so no decomposition.

### Background
Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid, is a medication used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions which aspirin is used to treat include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly after a heart attack decreases the risk of death. Aspirin, an acetyl derivative of salicylic acid, is a white, crystalline, weakly acidic substance, with a melting point of 136 °C (277 °F),[3] and a boiling point of 140 °C (284 °F).[133] Its acid dissociation constant (pKa) is 3.5 at 25 °C (77 °F).[134]

Acid breaks down molecules.  We know this because, in the stomach, hydrochloric acid activates pepsinogen into the enzyme pepsin, which then helps digestion by breaking the bonds linking amino acids, a process known as protein hydrolysis (IB Chemistry Book).  The same should also apply to aspirin.

### Method
1. Make a solution of 10.00 gram of aspirin in 100 cm3 of water.
2. Add 1.0 M HCl until the solution is pH 1.
3. Put solution in a water bath at 10 degrees (to make sure it is constant).
4. Measure the concentration of aspirin every 10 second for 10 minutes.  Write down the values.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 FIVE times to get uncertainty.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 at pH 2, 3, 4, 5.

### Data Analysis
Plot a graph of Concentration of Aspirin against pH.  Make a best fit line and measure the slope to show the hypothesis to be correct.
