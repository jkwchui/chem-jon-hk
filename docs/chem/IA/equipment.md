# Sensors and Equipment

This table shows the sensors and equipment we have in the lab.  

I marked each item with the science subjects it is likely to be useful for: equipment likely to be useful for chem IA/EEs are marked with a yellow tag.  Items are *first* sorted by subject and *then* alphabetically.

Where possible, Jack and I have described what the equipment is used for, and included a video tutorial when it is available.

You can search, sort, and filter this table.[^mobile]
